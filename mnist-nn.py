# MNIST digit recognizer
#
# The simple recognizer is implememted purely in Python.  The purpose of
# this program is to present the details how to constructa simple neural
# network for prediction from scratch:
#
# 1. To build a 3-layer neural network (only one hidden layer).
# 2. To train a model with self-implemented SGD (stochastic gradient descent).
# 3. To predict data with the trained model.
